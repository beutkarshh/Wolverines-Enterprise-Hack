## 🔧 Step 2: Configure Your System

### Add Exotel Credentials
Copy `.env.exotel.example` to your `.env` file and update:

```env
# ── EXOTEL CREDENTIALS ──────────────────────────────
EXOTEL_SID=your_account_sid_here
EXOTEL_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
EXOTEL_FROM_NUMBER=your_exotel_number_here

# ── WEBHOOK URL (for call handling) ──────────────────
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Set Up Public URL (Required for Webhooks)
Exotel needs to send call events to your server. Use **ngrok** for testing:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 3001

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Add it to your .env as BASE_URL
```

```bash
cd "d:/Projects/AI Voice agents/ai-caller-system/ai-caller"
node dashboard-server.js
```

### Test Single Call
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/exotel/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+919876543210", "name": "Test Student"}'
```

### Test from Dashboard
1. Open `http://localhost:3001`
2. Go to "Contacts" section
3. Click "Call" next to any contact
4. Monitor the call flow in server logs

---

## 📋 Step 4: Bulk Calling Campaign

```csv

Rahul Sharma,+919876543210,Pune
Priya Patil,+919876543211,Kolhapur
Amit Kumar,+919876543212,Nashik
```

### Start Bulk Campaign

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contactIds": [1,2,3,4,5], "delayMinutes": 0.5}'
